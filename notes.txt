Running:
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/vagrant/modules/users/files$ sudo puppet apply /vagrant/
manifests/site.pp  --verbose --debug --modulepath=/vagrant/modules

Had to use modulepath since the /vagrant/modules directory is not in puppet's default modulepath


On recurse:
false: default will set the mode, owner and group of the directory without touching any files inside it
true: copies files from the source to the target directory and applies the mode owner and group settings to all existing files inside the target directory
remote: copies the files from the source to the target directory, but does not touch any existing files in the target directory
